============
Introduction
============

MiniCPS is a lightweight simulator for accurate network traffic in an
industrial control system, with basic support for physical layer interaction.

This page summarizes the basic installation, configuration and testing of
MiniCPS. We provide a tutorial for beginners here: :ref:`swat-tutorial`. If
you need more information about a specific topic see :ref:`misc`.

.. REQUIREMENTS {{{3

Requirements: Installing Mininet
------------

You need to start MiniCPS installation by `installing
<http://mininet.org/download/>`_ Mininet and its dependencies.

Notice that Mininet can be installed either inside a Virtual Machine (VM)
or on your physical machine.
The official Mininet VM comes without an X-server that is an *optional*
requirements for MiniCPS (e.g., it can be used to display a pop-up window
with sensor data visualization). If you decide to install Mininet on your own, the following hints can be helpful.

Mininet seems to  assume a mininet user in the mininet group is present on the system. You need to create both

.. code-block:: console

   sudo useradd mininet
   sudo addgroup mininet


Mininet relies on openvswitch-controller as basic SDN controller (unless you install POX or other controllers yourself). Since Open vSwitch 2.1, the openvswitch-controller was renamed to openvswitch-testcontroller. This means you will have to a) ensure that you have the corresponding package installed, e.g. via (on Ubuntu 16.04 or later)

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt install openvswitch-testcontroller

Then, you need to patch the minicps source (e.g., /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mininet/clean.py and /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mininet/node.py) to use the updated binary name (change occurances of openvswitch-controller to openvswitch-testcontroller). 

.. code-block:: console

   find /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mininet/ -type f -exec sudo sed -i 's/ovs-controller/ovs-testcontroller/' {} \;

Ensure the corresponding service is running, e.g., by using    
   
.. code-block:: console

   sudo service openvswitch-switch start

You should now be able to start a simple topology without error messages by using 

.. code-block:: console

   sudo mn

   
The `Installing MiniCPS`_ section provides instructions to install ``minicps``
for a user or a developer, and it assumes that you *already* have installed
``mininet``.

.. INSTALL MINICPS {{{3

Installing MiniCPS
---------------

MiniCPS is can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo pip install minicps

Test the installation downloading one of our examples from
https://github.com/scy-phy/minicps/tree/master/examples and try to run it.

For example, given that you downloaded the ``examples`` directory,
then you can ``cd swat-s1`` folder and run:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo python run.py

And you should see the following:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Ping: testing ping reachability
   attacker -> plc1 plc2 plc3
   plc1 -> attacker plc2 plc3
   plc2 -> attacker plc1 plc3
   plc3 -> attacker plc1 plc2
   *** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)

.. INSTALL OPTIONAL {{{3
.. _install-optional:

Install Optional Packages
-------------------------


For *SDN controller development* there are many options,
``pox`` is a good starting point and Mininet's VM already includes it. If you
want to manually install it type:

.. code-block:: console

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/noxrepo/pox

MiniCPS pox controller files are tracked in the ``minicps`` repo itself.
To symlink them to pox's dedicated external controller folder ( ``pox/ext``)
execute the following:

.. code-block:: console

   ~/minicps/bin/pox-init.py [-p POX_PATH -m MINICPS_PATH -vv]

Notice that:

* You can increase the verbosity level using either ``v`` or  ``-vv``
* ``POX_PATH`` defaults to ``~/pox`` and ``MINICPS_PATH`` defaults to
  ``~/minicps``, indeed ``~/minicps/bin/init`` should work for you.

.. CONFIGURE MINICPS {{{2

Configure MiniCPS
==================

.. SSH {{{3

ssh
---

Mininet VM comes with a ssh server starting at boot. Check it using:

.. code-block:: console

   ps aux | grep ssh

You should see a ``/usr/sbin/sshd -D`` running process.

If you want to redirect X command to your host X-server ssh into mininet VM,
e.g., to display graphs even if your VM doesn't run an X server,
using the ``-Y`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    ssh -Y mininet@mininetvm

.. IPv6 {{{3

IPv6
----

In order to reduce the network traffic you can **disable** the
Linux ipv6 kernel module. (``mininet`` VM already disables it)

.. code-block:: console

    sudo vim /etc/default/grub

Search for ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`` and **prepend** to the string
``ipv6.disable=1``. You should obtain something like this:

.. code-block:: console

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 ..."

Where ``...`` is other text that you don't have to touch.

Then:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo update-grub

Then reboot your machine and check it with ``ifconfig`` that no
``inet6`` is listed.
