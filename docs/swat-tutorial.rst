This tutorial shows how to use MiniCPS to simulate a subprocess of a
Water Treatment testbed. In particular, we demonstrate basic controls through
simulated PLCs, the network traffic, and simple physical layer simulation. We
now provide:

* A list of the pre-requisites to run the tutorial
* A brief system overview
* Step-by-step instructions to run and modify the simulation

.. SYSTEM OVERVIEW {{{2

=================
System Overview
=================

This tutorial is based on the *Secure Water
Treatment* (*SWaT*) testbed, which is used by Singapore
University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s researcher and students in the
context of Cyber-Physical systems security research.

SWaT's subprocess are the followings:

P1: Supply and Storage
   Collect the raw water from the source

P2: Pre-treatment
   Chemically pre-treat the raw water

P3: UltraFiltration (UF) and Backwash
   Purify water and periodically clean the backwash filter

P4: De-Chlorination
   Chemically and/or physically remove excess Chlorine from water

P5: Reverse Osmosis (RO)
   Purify water, discard RO reject water

P6: Permeate transfer, cleaning and back-wash
   Storage of permeate (purified) water

.. SUPPLY AND STORAGE {{{3

Supply and Storage control
----------------------------

The simulation focuses on the first subprocess of the SWaT testbed.

.. image:: images/swat-tutorial-subprocess.png

As you can see from the figure, during normal
operating conditions the water flows into a Raw water tank (T101) passing through
an open motorized valve *MV101*. A flow level sensor *FIT101* monitors the
flow rate providing a measure in m^3/h.
The tank has a water level indicator *LIT101* providing a measure in
mm. A pump *P101* [#]_ is able to move the water to the next stage.
In our simulation we assume that the pump is either on or off and that its
flow rate is **constant** and can instantly change value.

The whole subprocess is controlled by three *PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)*.
*PLC1* takes the final decisions with the help of *PLC2* and *PLC3*. The
following is a schematic view of subprocess's control strategy:

* PLC1 will first:
   * Read LIT101
   * Compare LIT101 with well defined thresholds
   * Take a decision (e.g.: open P101 or close MV101)
   * Update its status

Then PLC1 has to communicate (using *EtherNet/IP*) with PLC2 and PLC3 that
are monitoring subprocess2 and subprocess3.

* PLC1 will then:
   * Ask to PLC2 FIT201's value
   * Compare FIT201 with well defined thresholds
   * Take a decision
   * Update its status
   * Ask to PLC3 LIT301's value
   * Compare LIT301 with well defined thresholds
   * Take a decision
   * Update its status

Notice that *asking to a PLC* is different from *reading from a sensor*,
indeed our simulation separate the two cases using different functions.

.. SWAT EXPLOTATION {{{2

=====================
MiniCPS simulation
=====================


.. SWAT TOPOLOGY {{{3

Topology
---------------

To initialize the simulation environment open up a terminal, navigate into the
root ``minicps`` directory, (the one containing a ``Makefile``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   make swat-s1-init

To start the simulation, from the same directory type:

.. code-block:: console

   make swat-s1

Now you should see the ``mininet`` CLI:

.. code-block:: console

   mininet>

Feel free to explore the network topology using ``mininet``'s built-in
commands such as: ``nodes``, ``dump``, ``net``, ``links`` etc.

At this time you should be able to answer questions such as:

* What is the IP address of PLC1?
* What are the (virtual) network interfaces?
* What is the network topology?

If you want to open a shell for a specific device, let's say ``plc1`` 
type:

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> xterm plc1


Now you can type any bash command from plc1 node, such that ``ping`` or
``ifconfig``.

At this time you should be able to answer questions such as:

* Are there web servers or ftp servers  running on some host ?
* Is the file system shared ?

Another convenient way to run bash commands is directly from the mininet prompt, 
for example type:

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> s1 wireshark

You can exit mininet by pressing ``C-d`` or typing:

.. code-block:: console

   mininet> exit

You can optionally clean the OS environment typing:

.. code-block:: console

   make clean-simulation

.. CUSTOMIZATION {{{3

.. TODO: add literalinclude plc logics
.. TODO: explain how to speed-up simulation

Customization
--------------

Open a terminal and ``cd examples/swat-s1/``. The files contained in this folder 
can be used as a template to implement your Cyber-Physical System simulation.
For example you can copy it in your home folder and start designing your CPS
simulation.

For the rest of the section we will use our SWaT subprocess simulation
example to show how to design, run and configure MiniCPS. Let's start
describing the various files used for the simulation.

The ``init.py`` script can be run once to generate the sqlite database containing
the state information.

The ``topo.py`` script contains the mininet ``SwatTopo(Topo)`` subclass used to set the
CPS topology and network parameters (e.g., IP, MAC, netmasks).

The ``run.py`` script contains the ``SwatS1CPS(MiniCPS)`` class that you can
use to customize your simulation. In this example the user has to manually run the
PLC logic scripts and physical process script, for example opening four ``xterm`` from the 
``mininet>`` prompt and launch the scripts. 
You can start every script automatically uncommenting the following lines:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/swat-s1/run.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL RUN(
   :end-before:  # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL RUN)

In this example it is required to start ``plc2.py`` and ``plc3.py``
**before** ``plc1.py`` because the latter will start requesting Ethernet/IP
tags from the formers to drive the system.

The ``utils.py`` module contains the shared constants and the configuration
dictionaries for each MIniCPS Device subclass. Let's take as an illustrative
example plc1 configuration dictionaries:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/swat-s1/utils.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL PLC1 UTILS(
   :end-before:  # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL PLC1 UTILS)

The ``PLC1_PROTOCOL`` dictionary
allows MiniCPS to use the correct network configuration settings for the 
``send`` and ``receive`` methods, in this case for plc1 
MiniCPS will initialize a ``cpppo`` Ethernet/IP servers with the specified
tags.

It is important to understand the ``mode`` encoding, mode is expected to be
a non-negative integer and it will set networking mode of the associated
Device. 
Use a ``1`` if you want a device that both is serving enip tags and
it is able to query an enip server, e.g., a PLC device.
Use a ``0`` if you want a device has only enip client capabilities,
e.g., an HMI device.
In case you want to simulate a Device that has no network capabilites you can
set the protocol dict to ``None``, e.g., a Tank device.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/swat-s1/utils.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL STATE(
   :end-before:  # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL STATE)

The ``STATE`` dictionary is shared among devices and 
allows MiniCPS to use the correct physical layer API for the ``set`` and
``get`` methods.

The simulation presents both physical and network interaction and the nice
thing about MiniCPS is that any device can use the **same** addressing
strategy to interact with the state and to request values through the network.
This example uses the following constants tuples as addresses:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/swat-s1/physical_process.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL TAGS(
   :end-before:  # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL TAGS)

We are using two fields, the first is a ``str`` indicating the name of the
tag and the second is an ``int`` indicating the plc number. For example: 

- plc2 will store an addressable real enip tag using  
  ``FIT201_2 = ('FIT201', 2)``
- plc1 will store in its enip server an addressable real enip tag using
  ``FIT201_1 = ('FIT201', 1)``

If you want to change the initial values of the simulation open
``physical_process.py`` and look at:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/swat-s1/physical_process.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL STATE INIT(
   :end-before:  # SPHINX_SWAT_TUTORIAL STATE INIT)

If you want to change any of the plcs logics take a look at ``plc1.py``,
``plc2.py`` and ``plc3.py`` and remember to set the relevant values in the
``utils.py`` module.

If you manually
run the logic script you can *plug-and-play* them in any fashion, e.g., you
can test the same plc logics in a scenario where a tank is supposed to
overflow and then stop the physical_process script and run another one where
the tank is supposed to underflow, without stopping the plcs scripts.

The ``log/`` directory is used to store log information about the simulation.

You can clean the simulation environment from minicps root directory using:

.. code-block:: console

   make clean-simulation
